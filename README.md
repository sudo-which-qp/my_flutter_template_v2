## QP Flutter Template

<p>So this is me trying to make a flutter template, if you have any issues please let me know.</p>

<p>You will be given a Counter App page that uses Cubit and not SetState, 
the project is structured on the Bloc Architecture, and it has been setup 
to suit my needs for building flutter app, anytime I want to make a new project I 
will use this template </p>

<p>But I built a CLI in Go to help me clone the project and make it for 
any project I want. The CLI will make sure to change the package name in 
yaml and in all the dart files to suit the name you created for the app</p>

<p> Here is the repo to the CLI <a href='https://github.com/sudo-which-qp/qp_flutter_cli.git'>QP Flutter CLI</a></p>
